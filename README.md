# Machine-Learning Journey Documentation

## Python Libraries
* TensorFlow/Keras. 
  TensorFlow allows you to make neural networks,  anything from computer vision to natural language processing, TensorFlow will help you out. Keras allows you to make machine learning models and is heavily integrated with Tensorflow v2 (the latest version of TensorFlow).
* PyTorch. 
  
* Pandas. 
  Pandas is a python library that allows you to store and read data from spreadsheets ( .csv, .xlsv files ) in structures called Dataframes.
* Numpy. 
  Numpy allows to manipulate the data. It replaces python lists and does the same things, like list slicing for example. However numpy lists are much faster to execute than the default python lists.
* Matplotlib. 
  Matplotlib is a library for plotting data into pie charts, bar charts, and whatever kinds of graphs you can imagine.
* SciKit Learn. 
  Scikit learn does a lot of things, from regression to classification, you name it.
* Seaborn. 
  Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and allows you to visualize data with support for themes (as in color schemes like VS code themes) and more visualization options.
